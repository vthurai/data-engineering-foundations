# 1. Basic Data Types
# 1.a) Number Types
x = 34 # Integer Type
y1 = 4 # Integer Type
y2 = 4.0 # Float Type

# What are the difference between both divisions statements? Why is that?
# Bonus: Run the below using Python2 and Python 3
print(x / y1)
print(x / y2)

# What are the difference between both multiplication statements? Why is that?
# Bonus: Run the below using Python2 and Python 3
print(x * y1)
print(x * y2)

# 1.b) String Type
# Create a string variable 'name' that will be used in the print statement below
print(f'Welcome to {name} python code')

# 2. Data type conversion
z1 = 16
z2 = 3.14
z3 = "8"

# 2.a) Print the types of z1, z2, z3.

# 2.b) Convert z1 to a float and z3 into an integer.

# 3. String Manipulation
a = "hello there"
b = "Goodbye now"
c = ""

# 3.a) Print the number of characters in each of these strings.

# 3.b) Strings in Python are *immutable*. They can't be changed once created.
print(a.replace("there", "friend"))
print(a)                              # Does not change the original string.
# Using replace(), how can you change the string in "a" to say "hello friend"?

# 3.c) Print the 3rd character of "a" and "b". What happens when you try to access the 3rd character of "c"?

## 4. Date Time and Time zone Offset
import datetime

# 4.a) Print the current time using the datetime library

# 4.b) Print the time in the above answer in the full date format (e.g. Sunday Febuary 12 2023)

# 4.c) Using the above time, create the following statement using the current time variable
# 'Right now its HH:MM (AM/PM) on [Weekday], [Month] [Day], [Year]'
# E.g. 'Right now its 8:23 PM on Sunday, February 12, 2023'

# 4.d) Using the logic above, create the same statement but convert to the approriate time zone in:
# - Vancouver
# - Paris
# - Tokyo
# E.g. 'Right now in Tokyo its 10:23 AM on Sunday, February 13, 2023'

# 4.e) Write a python statement that will print the current amount of days till Christmas

# 5. Boolean
# Booleans only take on two values: True or False

is_happy = True
is_hungry = False

# You can evaluate an integer or float into a boolean using bool().
# An integer or float with a value of zero will evaluate to False. Any other number will evaluate to True.

print(bool(0))
print(bool(14))
print(bool(3.14))

# 5.a) Try evaluating other types to see what they will convert to.

# 6. You can check the type of a variable using type().

print(type("I'm a string"))
print(type(99))

# 7. "None" is special keyword that denotes no value. None has it's own type: "NoneType".

nothing_here = None
print(nothing_here)
print(type(nothing_here))

# None will evaluate to False.

print(bool(None))
