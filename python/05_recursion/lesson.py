# 1. Recursion

# A recursive function is a function that calls itself.
# Like a while loop, a recursive function will loop endlessly if there is no exit condition.
def recursive_func():
    print("hello")
    return  # Removing this will cause an infinite recursive loop.
    recursive_func()
recursive_func()

# Let's write a function called factorial(n) that returns the factorial of a positive integer n.
# A factorial is the product of all positive integers from 1 to n: factorial(5) = 5*4*3*2*1 = 120.

# How to write a recursive function:
# Step 1 - Define your base case:
#           A base case is the point at which recursion should stop.
#           (Sometimes it is possible to have multiple base cases.)
#           In our factorial function, the base case is n==1. We don't go any further after that.
#           The base case is our exit condition. Without it, our recursive function will never stop.
# Step 2 - The recursive step:
#           If we have not reached the base case, then we recurse deeper into the function.
#           In our factorial function, we multiply n by the factorial of (n-1).
def factorial(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)

print(factorial(5))

# 1.a) Write a recursive function sum_all(n) that returns the sum of all integers from 1 to n.
# 1.b) Can you re-write sum_all(n) without using recursion?
# 1.c) (Bonus) Can you re-write sum_all(n) without using any loops at all?
