# You are building a game where your player is moving across a 10 x 10 array map. The game will have
# have the player start from the location (1,2) where x = 1 (second position in the horizontal) and
# y = 2 (third position in the vertical). Your code should allow the user to navigate around obstacles,
# prevent the player from going out of bounds, and confirm if the user has made it to the goal.

# Note:
#  1) The player will be marked as 'P' on the map and every time the user moves the player the map
#     should be printed to with the new players location
#  2) Conditional statements should be used to prevent the player from going out of bounds or into the
#     obstacle areas marked as 'X'
#  3) Player should be given a win statement when the reach the goal marked with '?'

# Legend:
# 'P' -> Player
# '-' -> Empty space for player to move
# 'X' -> Obstacle (player cant move on those spaces)
# '?' -> Goal

# The game will run in an infinite loop until the player wins. To escape the game use 'ctrl - c'
