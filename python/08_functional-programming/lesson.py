def my_function():
    return 15

a = my_function()
b = my_function

# What is the difference between a and b? What happens when you print them?

# 1. Lambda Î» functions
# A lambda function is an anonymous function (a function without a name).
# Named after lambda calculus - a system for expressing functions using formal logic.
# They are useful for when we want a small simple function but don't require a named function.
c = lambda: 15
print(c())
print(c)

# Lambda functions can take arguments as well.
product = lambda x, y: x*y
print(product(3, 6))
print((lambda x, y: x + y)(12, 31))


# 2. Functions for functions
# There are several helper functions that may be useful for you when working with functions:

# 2.a) Map
# > map(func, iterable)
# Map is a built-in function.
# Map takes a *function* as its first parameter, and an iterable as its second parameter.
# An iterable is an object that can be iterated (each element can be traversed).
# Lists and tuples are examples of iterables. Map then applies the function to every element.
times_two = map(lambda x: x*2, [3, 5, 7])   # Lambda functions are useful here!

# Map returns a reference to a map object.
print(times_two)

# To see the results, change it's type to a list
print(list(times_two))

# 2.b) Filter
# > filter(bool_func, iterable)
# Filter is a built-in function.
# Filter takes a function as its first parameter. This function must return a boolean.
# Filter takes an iterable as its second parameter. Filter then creates a new list for which
# the function returns True when applied to every element.
less_than_five = filter(lambda x: x < 5, [2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 11])
print(list(less_than_five))

# 2.c) Reduce
# > reduce(func, iterable)
# Reduce takes a function as its first parameter. This function must take two arguments.
# Reduce takes an iterable as its second parameter.
# Reduce applies the function to the first two elements. Then, it will continuously apply the
# function using the result and the next element, until no more items are remaining.
from functools import reduce  # Reduce needs to be imported first.
add_all = reduce((lambda x, y: x + y), [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
print(add_all)  # No need to cast to a list here.

# 3. Decorators TODO
