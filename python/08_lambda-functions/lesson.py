# What is the difference between a and b? What happens when you print them?

# 1. Lambda Î» functions
# A lambda function is an anonymous function (a function without a name).
# Named after lambda calculus - a system for expressing functions using mathematical logic.
# They are useful when we want to create a small simple function but don't require a named function.

c = lambda: 15
print(c())
print(c)

# Lambda functions can take arguments as well.

product = lambda x, y: x*y
print(product(3, 6))


# 2. Map
# > map(func, iterable)
# Map is a built-in function. Map takes a *function* as it's first parameter, and an iterable as it's second parameter.
# An iterable is an object that can be iterated (each element can be traversed). Lists and tuples are iterable.
# Map then applies the function to every element.

times_two = map(lambda x: x*2, [3, 5, 7])      # Lambda functions are useful here!

# Map returns a reference to a map object.
print(times_two)
# To see the results, change it's type to a list
print(list(times_two))


# 3. Filter
# > filter(bool_func, iterable)
# Filter is a built-in function.
# Filter takes a function as it's first parameter. This function must return a boolean. Filter takes an iterable as it's second parameter.
# Filter then creates a new list for which the function returns true when applied to every element.

less_than_five = filter(lambda x: x < 5, [2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 11])
print(list(less_than_five))


# 4. Reduce
# > reduce(func, iterable)
# Reduce takes a function as it's first parameter. This function must take two arguments. Reduce takes an iterable as it's second parameter.
# Reduce then applies the function to the first two elements. Then, it will apply the same function using the result and the next element.
# This continues for every element until none are remaining.

from functools import reduce    # Reduce needs to be imported first.
add_all = reduce((lambda x, y: x + y), [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
print(add_all)                  # No need to cast to a list here.


# 5. Zip
# > zip(*iterables)
# Zip is a built in function. Zip takes two or more iterables, and produces a list of tuples.
# Each tuple produced will contain an item from each one supplied.
# By default, zip will stop when the shortest iterable has exhausted all elements.

zip_me = zip([1, 2, 3], ['sugar', 'spice', 'everything nice'])
print(list(zip_me))
zip_me_again = zip(range(3), ['fee', 'fi', 'fo', 'fum'])
print(list(zip_me_again))
